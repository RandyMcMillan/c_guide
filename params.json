In no way does this guide attempt to teach one how to program in C, nor will it attempt to provide the history of C or the various implementations of it. It is merely a handy reference to the standard C library. This guide is not a definitive look at the entire ANSI C standard. It is simply a quick reference to the functions and syntax of the language.\r\n\r\nHome page: [http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/index.html](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/index.html)\r\n \r\n[Download](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide.tar.gz) or read it online here: [http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/index.html](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/index.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
