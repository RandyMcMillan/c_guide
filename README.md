The C Library Reference Guide 
by Eric Huss
1997
Description:
This guide provides a useful look at the standard C programming language. In no way does this guide attempt to teach one how to program in C, nor will it attempt to provide the history of C or the various implementations of it. It is merely a handy reference to the standard C library. This guide is not a definitive look at the entire ANSI C standard. It is simply a quick reference to the functions and syntax of the language.
